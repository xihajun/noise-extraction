autoencoder and cnn model to extract noise or bad features from paper

For traditional cnn, I have tried that it is hard to learn what type of paper it is. But some paper have some features which could be seen by eyes. So I think it might be able to use autoencoder to reduce the noise and compared with the recovered image, we are able to get the paper features.

The structure is just a traditional conv autoencoder + cnn
